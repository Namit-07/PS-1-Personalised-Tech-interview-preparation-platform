    25
  );

  // 3. Difficulty Distribution (20%)
  const idealRatio = { easy: 0.3, medium: 0.5, hard: 0.2 };
  const userRatio = calculateDifficultyRatio(user);
  const diffScore = (
    1 - Math.abs(userRatio.easy - idealRatio.easy) -
    Math.abs(userRatio.medium - idealRatio.medium) -
    Math.abs(userRatio.hard - idealRatio.hard)
  ) * 20;

  // 4. Company-Specific Prep (15%)
  const companyProblems = getCompanyTaggedProblems(user.targetCompany);
  const solvedCompanyProblems = user.solvedProblems.filter(p =>
    companyProblems.includes(p)
  );
  const companyScore = (
    solvedCompanyProblems.length / Math.min(companyProblems.length, 50)
  ) * 15;

  // 5. Consistency (10%)
  const consistencyScore = Math.min((user.currentStreak / 30) * 10, 10);

  // Total
  const total = topicScore + problemScore + diffScore + companyScore + consistencyScore;

  return {
    probability: Math.round(total),
    breakdown: {
      topicCoverage: topicScore,
      problemsSolved: problemScore,
      difficultyBalance: diffScore,
