# ‚úÖ ALL FIXES COMPLETED!

## üéØ What Was Fixed:

### 1. ‚úÖ Environment Variables
- `.env.local` already exists with correct API URL
- `backend/.env.example` exists as template

### 2. ‚úÖ Hardcoded API URLs Replaced
**Files Updated:**
- `app/(auth)/login/page.jsx` - Now uses `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`
- `app/lib/ActivityContext.js` - All 3 fetch calls now use env variable
- `app/(auth)/signup/page.jsx` - Onboarding API call uses env variable

**Before:**
```javascript
fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/...')
```

**After:**
```javascript
const API_URL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || 'http://localhost:5000/api';
fetch(`${API_URL}/...`)
```

### 3. ‚úÖ Debug Console Logs Removed
**Files Cleaned:**
- `app/lib/ActivityContext.js` - Removed 6 console.log statements
- `app/(auth)/signup/page.jsx` - Removed 10 debug logs
- `app/components/AIChat.jsx` - Removed redundant error logging

**Kept for Production:**
- `console.error()` statements (useful for debugging actual errors)
- Critical error logging in try-catch blocks

### 4. ‚úÖ Better Error Handling
**File:** `app/problems/[slug]/page.jsx`

**Before:**
```javascript
catch (error) {
  alert('Error submitting solution. Please try again.');
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
catch (error) {
  setResult({
    passed: false,
    message: error.response?.data?.message || 'Error submitting solution. Please try again.'
  });
}
```
Now errors display in the UI instead of browser alerts!
