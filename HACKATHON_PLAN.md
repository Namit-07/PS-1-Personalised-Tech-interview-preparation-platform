## 🔥 CRITICAL DECISIONS (Save Time!)

### ✅ DO THIS:
- **Use Mock Data**: Seed 30 problems manually, not 500
- **Simple UI**: Clean Tailwind, no complex animations

- **Pre-made Components**: Copy from Tailwind UI/Shadcn

### ❌ SKIP THIS:
- ❌ Email verification
- ❌ Password reset
- ❌ Profile pictures
- ❌ Social auth
- ❌ Code execution (just simulate)
- ❌ Multiple modules (just DSA)
- ❌ Mobile app
- ❌ Complex animations
- ❌ Comment system
- ❌ User settings page
