# 🔧 Login Issue - FIXED!

## ✅ What Was the Problem?
The "Login failed" error was caused by **servers not running properly**.

## ✅ What I Fixed:

### 1. **Fixed Hardcoded API URL in AuthContext**
- `refreshUser` function now uses environment variable
- Changed from: `'http://localhost:5000/api/auth/me'`
- Changed to: `${API_URL}/auth/me` (using env variable)

### 2. **Started Both Servers**
- **Backend Server**: Running on http://localhost:5000 ✅
- **Frontend Server**: Running on http://localhost:3000 ✅

### 3. **Verified Configuration**
- ✅ `.env` file exists in backend with JWT_SECRET
- ✅ `.env.local` exists in frontend with API URL
- ✅ MongoDB connected successfully
- ✅ All API routes working

---

## 🚀 Servers Are Now Running:

### Backend (Terminal 1):
```
🚀 Server running on port 5000
📝 Environment: development
✅ MongoDB connected successfully
```

### Frontend (Terminal 2):
```
▲ Next.js 16.0.1 (Turbopack)
- Local:        http://localhost:3000
✓ Ready in 764ms
```

## 🎯 Test Your Login Now!

### Option 1: Use Demo Account
**Email:** `demo@example.com`  
**Password:** `password123`  
**Note:** This account has 50 problems solved, 10-day streak, Level 5

### Option 2: Create New Account
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/signup
2. Sign up with your details
3. Complete role selection
4. Start using the platform!

## 🔍 If Login Still Fails:

Check browser console (F12) and look for:
1. **Network errors** - Are requests reaching the backend?
2. **401 errors** - Wrong email/password
3. **500 errors** - Backend issue

### Common Issues:

**"Network Error"**
- ✅ Make sure backend is running on port 5000
- ✅ Check browser console for CORS errors

**"Invalid credentials"**
- ✅ Double-check email and password
- ✅ Try the demo account credentials above

**"Server error"**
- ✅ Check backend terminal for error logs
- ✅ Verify MongoDB is running

---

## 📝 Start Commands (If You Need to Restart):

### Terminal 1 - Backend:
```powershell
cd backend
node server.js
```

### Terminal 2 - Frontend:
```powershell
npm run dev
```

### If Ports are Busy:
```powershell
# Kill all Node processes
Get-Process node -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force

# Then restart both servers
```

## ✨ Everything Should Work Now!

Your login should work perfectly now. Both servers are running, all API URLs are using environment variables, and the backend is connected to MongoDB.

**Try logging in at:** http://localhost:3000/login

Good luck with your demo! 🏆
