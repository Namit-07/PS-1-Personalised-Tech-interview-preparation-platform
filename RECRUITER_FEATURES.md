## 📊 Scoring Algorithm

### How Rankings Work

Percentile = ((Total Users - Rank + 1) / Total Users) × 100
Top Performer = Percentile >= 90%
```

### Streak Calculation
- Consecutive days of problem-solving activity
- Tracked via UserActivity model
- Bonus: 5 points per streak day
- Shows commitment and consistency

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Database Schema (User Model)
```javascript
{
  role: { 
    type: String, 
    enum: ['student', 'recruiter'], 
    default: null 
  },
  roleSelected: { 
    type: Boolean, 
    default: false 
  }
}
```

### API Endpoints
- `PUT /api/auth/role` - Save user role
- `GET /api/leaderboard` - Fetch rankings
  - Query params: `period` (all/week/month), `category` (overall/dsa/etc)
- `GET /api/leaderboard/user/:userId` - Individual user rank

### Frontend Components
- **Navbar** (`app/components/Navbar.jsx`)
  - Conditional navigation based on `user.role`
  - Role badge display
  
- **Role Selection** (`app/role-selection/page.jsx`)
  - Beautiful dual-card layout
  - Saves role via API
  - Routes to appropriate page

- **Leaderboard** (`app/leaderboard/page.jsx`)
  - Conditional header/messaging for recruiters
  - Full rankings with contact info
  - Filters and percentile calculations

### Routing Logic (`app/(auth)/login/page.jsx`)
```javascript
if (!user.roleSelected) {
  router.push('/role-selection')
} else if (user.role === 'recruiter') {
  router.push('/leaderboard')
} else if (!user.onboardingComplete) {
  router.push('/dashboard') // Student onboarding
} else {
  router.push('/dashboard') // Student dashboard
}
```
